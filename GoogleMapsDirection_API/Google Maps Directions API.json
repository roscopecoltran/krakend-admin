Waypoints offer the ability to alter a route through a specific location.

You can search for directions for several modes of transportation, including transit, driving, walking, or cycling.\nDetailed documentation is available at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/start.\n\nNote: URLs must be properly encoded to be valid and are limited to 8192 characters for all web services.
