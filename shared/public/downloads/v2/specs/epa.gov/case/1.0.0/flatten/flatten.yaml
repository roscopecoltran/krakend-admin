  state agency may be in the form of:\n- A notice of violation or a Superfund notice
  letter.\n-> An administrative order or order (either with or without penalties)
  directing an individual, a business, or other entity to take action to come into
  compliance, or to clean up a site.\n\nJudicial Cases are formal lawsuits, filed
  in court, against persons or entities that have failed to comply with statutory
  or regulatory requirements, with an administrative order, or who owe EPA response
  costs for cleaning up a Superfund site. These cases are filed by the U.S. Department
  of Justice on behalf of EPA and, in regulatory cases, by the State's Attorneys General
  for the states as well.\n\nCriminal Cases occur when EPA or a state enforce against
  a company or person through a criminal action. Criminal actions are usually reserved
  for the most serious violations, those that are willful, or knowingly committed.
  A court conviction can result in fines or imprisonment."

info.description: "Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed
  and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public
  use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for about 800,000
  regulated facilities nationwide.\n<BR><BR>CASE Rest Services provide multiple service
  endpoints, each with specific capabilities, to search and retrieve data on civil
  cases entered into the \nIntegrated Compliance Information System (ICIS) and criminal
  cases entered into the Summary of Criminal Prosecutions database.  \nSee Enforcement
  Case Search Help (https://echo.epa.gov/help/enforcement-case-search-help) for additional
  information on searching civil and criminal cases. \n<BR><BR>\nThe get_cases, get_map,
  get_qid, and get_download end points are meant to be used together.<br>  \nThe recommended
  use scenario for get_cases, get_qid, get_map, and get_downoad is:\n<br>\n<br><b>1)</b>
  \ Use get_cases to validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and
  to obtain a query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately
  30 minutes.\n<br><b>2)</b>  Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through
  arrays of case results.\n<br><b>3)</b>  Use get_map, with the returned QID, to zoom
  in/out and pan on the clustered and individual facility coordinates, related to
  the returned cases, that meet the QID query criteria.\n<br><b>4)</b>  Use get_download,
  with the returned QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of facility
  information that meets the QID query criteria.\n<br><br>\nIn addition to the service
  endpoints listed above there are two detailed case report services, one for civil
  cases (get_case_report) and one for criminal cases (get_crcase_report). \nSee the
  Civil Enforcement Case Report Help (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/enforcement-case-report-help)
  and the Criminal Case Report Help (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/criminal-case-report-help)
  for additional information \non then data returned from these two services.   \n<br>\nAdditional
