info.description: "Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed
  and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public
  use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for about 800,000
  regulated facilities nationwide.\n<BR><BR>CWA Rest Services provides multiple service
  endpoints, each with specific capabilities, to search and retrieve data on facilities
  regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and managed under the National Pollutant
  Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program. The returned results reflect data
  drawn from EPA's ICIS-NPDES database.\n<BR><BR>\nThe get_facilities, get_map, get_qid,
  and get_download end points are meant to be used together, while the enhanced get_facility_info
  end point is self contained.\n  The get_facility_info end point returns either an
  array of state, county or zip clusters with summary statistics per cluster or an
  array of facilities.\n<br><br>\nThe recommended use scenario for get_facilities,
  get_qid, get_map, and get_downoad is:\n<br>\n<br><b>1)</b>  Use get_facilities to
  validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain a query_id
  (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately 30 minutes.\n<br><b>2)</b>
  \ Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through arrays of facility results.\n<br><b>3)</b>
  \ Use get_map, with the returned QID, to zoom in/out and pan on the clustered and
  individual facility coordinates that meet the QID query criteria.\n<br><b>4)</b>
  \ Use get_download, with the returned QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV)
  file of facility information that meets the QID query criteria.\n<br>\n<br>\nUse
  the qcolumns parameter to customize your search results.  Use the Metdata service
  endpoint for a list of available output objects, their Column Ids, and their definitions
  to help you build your customized output. \n<br><br>\nAdditional ECHO Resources:
