  description: |
    Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for about 800,000 regulated facilities nationwide.
    <BR><BR>DFR Rest Services provide multiple service endpoints, to retrieve detailed facility location, enforcement, compliance monitoring, and pollutant information for any single facility.  See the Detailed Facility Report (DFR) Help Page (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/detailed-facility-report-help) for additional information on the DFR.  Additionally, a Data Dictionary (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/dfr-data-dictionary) is also available.<BR><BR>
    There is one primary service end point, get_dfr, that provides all available DFR data.  All other service end points that are exposed, will return data on a single section of the DFR. <br>

        This procedure obtains data for the CWA SNC/RNC History section located in the Three Year ompliance Status by Quarter portion of the DFR. Valid Compliance Statuses are as follows.
        > S = SNC/Category I - an enforcement action has been issued, and the facility is not meeting its compliance schedule
        > E = SNC/Category I - effluent violations of monthly average limits (Technical Review Criteria and chronic)
        > X = SNC/Category I - effluent violations of non-monthly average limits (Technical Review Criteria and chronic)
        > T = SNC/Category I - compliance schedule reporting violation
        > D = SNC/Category I - reporting violation - nonreceipt of DMR
        > N = RNC/Category II - reportable non-compliance
        > P = Resolved Pending - an enforcement action has been issued, and facility compliance with the action is pending final completion
        > R = Resolved - the facility has returned to compliance with its permit conditions, either with or without issuance of an enforcement action
        > C = Not considered in RNC/SNC based on manual review of data by state or EPA region. This manual override status is also indicated by a superscripted "m".
        > Blank = Not considered in RNC/SNC
        > N/A = EPA's data system is not able to determine the facility-level compliance status based upon the information available. This information may be available from a state database.

          The EPA data system in which permit and facility records are kept. EPA's Facility Registry System (FRS) links all program database records (such as permit IDs and IDs facilities use in reporting to EPA) together. The following list describes the individual data systems that are linked to from the detailed facility report: 

          - AFS: Air Facility System for Clean Air Act stationary source programs.
          - ICP: Integrated Compliance Information System for Clean Water Act programs monitoring National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.
          - RCR: Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information System (RCRAInfo) for tracking the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs.
          - NCDB: National Compliance Database System for monitoring national performance of the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); the Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 (EPCRA); the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response (AHERA); and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
          - TRI: Toxics Release Inventory for Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 submissions.
          - NEI: National Emissions Inventory database contains information on stationary and mobile sources that emit criteria air pollutants and their precursors, as well as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The database includes estimates of annual emissions, by source, of air pollutants in each area of the country, on an annual basis.
          - TSCA: Toxic Substances Control Act addressing the production, importation, use, and disposal of specific chemicals.

          The EPA data system in which permit and facility records are kept. EPA's Facility Registry System (FRS) links all program database records (such as permit IDs and IDs facilities use in reporting to EPA) together. The following list describes the individual data systems that are linked to from the detailed facility report: 

          - AFS: Air Facility System for Clean Air Act stationary source programs.
          - ICP: Integrated Compliance Information System for Clean Water Act programs monitoring National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.
          - RCR: Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information System (RCRAInfo) for tracking the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs.
          - NCDB: National Compliance Database System for monitoring national performance of the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); the Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 (EPCRA); the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response (AHERA); and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
          - TRI: Toxics Release Inventory for Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 submissions.
          - NEI: National Emissions Inventory database contains information on stationary and mobile sources that emit criteria air pollutants and their precursors, as well as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The database includes estimates of annual emissions, by source, of air pollutants in each area of the country, on an annual basis.
          - TSCA: Toxic Substances Control Act addressing the production, importation, use, and disposal of specific chemicals.

          The EPA data system in which permit and facility records are kept. EPA's Facility Registry System (FRS) links all program database records (such as permit IDs and IDs facilities use in reporting to EPA) together. The following list describes the individual data systems that are linked to from the detailed facility report: 

          - AFS: Air Facility System for Clean Air Act stationary source programs.
          - ICP: Integrated Compliance Information System for Clean Water Act programs monitoring National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.
          - RCR: Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information System (RCRAInfo) for tracking the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs.
          - NCDB: National Compliance Database System for monitoring national performance of the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); the Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 (EPCRA); the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response (AHERA); and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
          - TRI: Toxics Release Inventory for Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 submissions.
          - NEI: National Emissions Inventory database contains information on stationary and mobile sources that emit criteria air pollutants and their precursors, as well as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The database includes estimates of annual emissions, by source, of air pollutants in each area of the country, on an annual basis.
          - TSCA: Toxic Substances Control Act addressing the production, importation, use, and disposal of specific chemicals.
