    description: "Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed
      and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public
      use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for about
      800,000 regulated facilities nationwide.\n<BR><BR>DFR Rest Services provide
      multiple service endpoints, to retrieve detailed facility location, enforcement,
      compliance monitoring, and pollutant information for any single facility.  See
      the Detailed Facility Report (DFR) Help Page (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/detailed-facility-report-help)
      for additional information on the DFR.  Additionally, a Data Dictionary (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/dfr-data-dictionary)
      is also available.<BR><BR>\nThere is one primary service end point, get_dfr,
      that provides all available DFR data.  All other service end points that are
      exposed, will return data on a single section of the DFR. <br>  \n<br>\nAdditional
