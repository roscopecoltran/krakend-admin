				"description": "Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public use. \nECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for about 800,000 regulated facilities nationwide.\n\u003cBR\u003e\u003cBR\u003eECHO Rest Services provide multiple service endpoints, each with specific capabilities, \nto search and retrieve data on facilities regulated as Clean Air Act (CAA) stationary sources, Clean Water Act (CWA) dischargers, \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste generators/handlers, and Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) public water systems. Data of interest from other EPA sources, \nsuch as the Toxics Release Inventory, is also supplied for context.\n\u003cBR\u003e\u003cBR\u003e\nThe get_facilities, get_map, get_qid, and get_download end points are meant to be used together, while the enhanced get_facility_info end point is self contained.\n  The get_facility_info end point returns either an array of state, county or zip clusters with summary statistics per cluster or an array of facilities.\n\u003cBR\u003e\u003cBR\u003e\nThe recommended use scenario for get_facilities, get_qid, get_map, and get_downoad is:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e1)\u003c/b\u003e  Use get_facilities to validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain a query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately 30 minutes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e2)\u003c/b\u003e  Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through arrays of facility results.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e3)\u003c/b\u003e  Use get_map, with the returned QID, to zoom in/out and pan on the clustered and individual facility coordinates that meet the QID query criteria.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e4)\u003c/b\u003e  Use get_download, with the returned QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of facility information that meets the QID query criteria.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUse the qcolumns parameter to customize your search results.  Use the Metdata service endpoint for a list of available output objects, their Column Ids, and their definitions to help you build your customized output. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAdditional ECHO Resources:   \u003ca href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/web-services\"\u003eWeb Services\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/resources/echo-data/about-the-data\"\u003eAbout ECHO's Data\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads\"\u003eData Downloads\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n",
