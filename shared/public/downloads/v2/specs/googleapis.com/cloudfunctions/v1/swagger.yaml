        Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the

        NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding
        to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`. To
        override the binding, API services can add a binding such as
        `"/v1/{name=users/*}/operations"` to their service configuration.
        For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations
        collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding
        is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.

  Status:
    description: |-
      The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
      programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
      [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:

      - Simple to use and understand for most users
      - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs

      # Overview

      The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
      and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
      google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
      error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
      developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
      error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
      localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
      information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
      in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.

      # Language mapping

      The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
      is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
      exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
      mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
      in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.

      # Other uses

      The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
      environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
      consistent developer experience across different environments.

      Example uses of this error model include:

      - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
          it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
          errors.

      - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
          have a `Status` message for error reporting.

      - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
          `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
          each error sub-response.

      - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
          results in its response, the status of those operations should be
          represented directly using the `Status` message.

      - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
          be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
