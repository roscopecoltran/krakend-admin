        A notification set returned needs to be acknowledged within 20 seconds by calling Enterprises.AcknowledgeNotificationSet, unless the notification set is empty.
        Notifications that are not acknowledged within the 20 seconds will eventually be included again in the response to another PullNotificationSet request, and those that are never acknowledged will ultimately be deleted according to the Google Cloud Platform Pub/Sub system policy.
        Multiple requests might be performed concurrently to retrieve notifications, in which case the pending notifications (if any) will be split among each caller, if any are pending.
        If no notifications are present, an empty notification list is returned. Subsequent requests may return more notifications once they become available.

      An Enterprises resource represents the binding between an EMM and a specific organization. That binding can be instantiated in one of two different ways using this API as follows: 
      - For Google managed domain customers, the process involves using Enterprises.enroll and Enterprises.setAccount (in conjunction with artifacts obtained from the Admin console and the Google API Console) and submitted to the EMM through a more-or-less manual process. 
      - For managed Google Play Accounts customers, the process involves using Enterprises.generateSignupUrl and Enterprises.completeSignup in conjunction with the managed Google Play sign-up UI (Google-provided mechanism) to create the binding without manual steps. As an EMM, you can support either or both approaches in your EMM console. See Create an Enterprise for details.

  Entitlement:
    description: |-
      The presence of an Entitlements resource indicates that a user has the right to use a particular app. Entitlements are user specific, not device specific. This allows a user with an entitlement to an app to install the app on all their devices. It's also possible for a user to hold an entitlement to an app without installing the app on any device.

      The API can be used to create an entitlement. As an option, you can also use the API to trigger the installation of an app on all a user's managed devices at the same time the entitlement is created.

      If the app is free, creating the entitlement also creates a group license for that app. For paid apps, creating the entitlement consumes one license, and that license remains consumed until the entitlement is removed. If the enterprise hasn't purchased enough licenses, then no entitlement is created and the installation fails. An entitlement is also not created for an app if the app requires permissions that the enterprise hasn't accepted.

      If an entitlement is deleted, the app may be uninstalled from a user's device. As a best practice, uninstall the app by calling  Installs.delete() before deleting the entitlement.

      Entitlements for apps that a user pays for on an unmanaged profile have "userPurchase" as the entitlement reason. These entitlements cannot be removed via the API.

  GroupLicense:
    description: |-
      Group license objects allow you to keep track of licenses (called entitlements) for both free and paid apps. For a free app, a group license is created when an enterprise admin first approves the product in Google Play or when the first entitlement for the product is created for a user via the API. For a paid app, a group license object is only created when an enterprise admin purchases the product in Google Play for the first time.

      Use the API to query group licenses. A Grouplicenses resource includes the total number of licenses purchased (paid apps only) and the total number of licenses currently in use. Iyn other words, the total number of Entitlements that exist for the product.

      Only one group license object is created per product and group license objects are never deleted. If a product is unapproved, its group license remains. This allows enterprise admins to keep track of any remaining entitlements for the product.

Note that the enterprise itself needs to be granted access to the alpha and/or beta tracks, regardless of whether individual users or admins have access to those tracks.

  User:
    description: |-
      A Users resource represents an account associated with an enterprise. The account may be specific to a device or to an individual user (who can then use the account across multiple devices). The account may provide access to managed Google Play only, or to other Google services, depending on the identity model: 
      - The Google managed domain identity model requires synchronization to Google account sources (via primaryEmail). 
      - The managed Google Play Accounts identity model provides a dynamic means for enterprises to create user or device accounts as needed. These accounts provide access to managed Google Play.
