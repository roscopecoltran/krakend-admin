        Sets or updates the billing account associated with a project. You specify
        the new billing account by setting the `billing_account_name` in the
        `ProjectBillingInfo` resource to the resource name of a billing account.
        Associating a project with an open billing account enables billing on the
        project and allows charges for resource usage. If the project already had a
        billing account, this method changes the billing account used for resource
        usage charges.

        *Note:* Incurred charges that have not yet been reported in the transaction
        history of the Google Cloud Console may be billed to the new billing
        account, even if the charge occurred before the new billing account was
        assigned to the project.

        The current authenticated user must have ownership privileges for both the
        [project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/permissions-overview#h.bgs0oxofvnoo
        ) and the [billing
        account](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/4430947).

        You can disable billing on the project by setting the
        `billing_account_name` field to empty. This action disassociates the
        current billing account from the project. Any billable activity of your
        in-use services will stop, and your application could stop functioning as
        expected. Any unbilled charges to date will be billed to the previously
        associated account. The current authenticated user must be either an owner
        of the project or an owner of the billing account for the project.

        Note that associating a project with a *closed* billing account will have
        much the same effect as disabling billing on the project: any paid
        resources used by the project will be shut down. Thus, unless you wish to
        disable billing, you should always call this method with the name of an
        *open* billing account.
