      The SimplyRETS API is an exciting step towards making it easier for
      developers and real estate agents to build something awesome with
      real estate data!

      The documentation below makes live requests to our API using the
      trial data. To get set up with the API using live MLS data, you
      must have RETS credentials from your MLS, which you can then use to
      create an app with SimplyRETS. For more information on that
      process, please see our [FAQ](https://simplyrets.com/faq), [Getting
      Started](https://simplyrets.com/blog/getting-set-up.html) page, or
      [contact us](https://simplyrets.com/\#home-contact).

      Below you'll find the API endpoints, query parameters, response bodies,
      and other information about using the SimplyRETS API. You can run
      queries by clicking the 'Try it Out' button at the bottom of each
      section.

      ### Authentication
      The SimplyRETS API uses Basic Authentication. When you create an
      app, you'll get a set of API credentials to access your
      listings. If you're trying out the test data, you can use
      `simplyrets:simplyrets` for connecting to the API.

      ### Media Types
      The SimplyRETS API uses the `Accept` header to allow clients to
      control media types (content versions). We maintain backwards
      compatibility with API clients by allowing them to specify a
      content version. We highly recommend setting and explicity media
      type when your application reaches production. Both the structure
      and content of our API response bodies is subject to change so we
      can add new features while respecting the stability of applications
      which have already been developed.

      To always use the latest SimplyRETS content version, simply use
      `application/json` in your application `Accept` header.

      If you want to pin your clients media type to a specific version,
      you can use the vendor-specific SimplyRETS media type, e.g.
      `application/vnd.simplyrets-v0.1+json"`

      To view all valid content-types for making an `OPTIONS`, make a
      request to the SimplyRETS api root

      `curl -XOPTIONS -u simplyrets:simplyrets https://api.simplyrets.com/`

      The default media types used in our API responses may change in the
      future. If you're building an application and care about the
      stability of the API, be sure to request a specific media type in the
      Accept header as shown in the examples below.

      The wordpress plugin automatically sets the `Accept` header for the
      compatible SimplyRETS media types.

      ### Pagination

      To paginate through listings, start your query with these
      parameters: 'limit=500&lastId=0'. The 'lastId' is the important
      part, you can use any limit up to 500. When you receive the
      response from the API with the results, check the 'Link' header for
      the 'next' link. That link is pre-built to access the next 'page'
      of listings. Alternatively, you can use the last listing's 'mlsId'
      from the previous request and use that in the next query. For
      example:

      First query:

      curl -u username:password 'https://api.simplyrets.com/properties?limit=500&lastId=0'

      If the 'mlsId' in the last listing of the results is '1234567', then the next query will be:

      curl -u username:password 'https://api.simplyrets.com/properties?limit=500&lastId=1234567'

      ...and so one until you have reached the final page of listings.

      There a few pieces of useful information about each request stored
      in the HTTP Headers:

      - `X-Total-Count` shows you the total amount of listings that match
        your current query.
      - `Link` contains pre-built pagination links for accessing the next
      'page' of listings that match your query.

      ### RETS Vendor Compliance

      Many RETS vendors have strict requirements for showing disclaimers
      with specific information embedded. For example, in many areas it's
      required to show the time of the last listing refresh inside the
      disclaimer.

      The timestamp of the last listing refresh timestamp can be found in
      one of two spots:

      - The `X-SimplyRETS-LastUpdate` header from `GET /properties` or `GET /properties/{mlsId}`

      - Calling the API root `/` or properties api endpoint `/properties`
        with an OPTIONS request

        - `OPTIONS /`

          Using this route, you can see the timestamp for all RETS
          vendors associated with your account.
