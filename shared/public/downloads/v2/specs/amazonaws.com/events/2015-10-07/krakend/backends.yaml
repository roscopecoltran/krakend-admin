    description: <p>Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes
      in your AWS resources. When your resources change state, they automatically
      send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events
      in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules
      to take action on a pre-determined schedule. For example, you can configure
      rules to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update
      DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running
      state.</p> </li> <li> <p>Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon
