The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Organizations. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see \u003ca href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\"\u003eTools for Amazon Web Services\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/note\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Organizations.

Anyone who has the access key for your root account has unrestricted access to all the resources in your account. Instead, create an access key for an IAM user account that has administrative privileges. As another option, use AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials, and use those credentials to sign requests. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo sign requests, we recommend that you use \u003ca href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\"\u003eSignature Version 4\u003c/a\u003e.
