    description: <p>AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow
      called a pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline handles the details of scheduling and ensuring
      that data dependencies are met so that your application can focus on processing
      the data.</p> <p>AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR implementation of a task runner
      called AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner. AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner provides
      logic for common data management scenarios, such as performing database queries
      and running data analysis using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can
      use AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner as your task runner, or you can write your
      own task runner to provide custom data management.</p> <p>AWS Data Pipeline
      implements two main sets of functionality. Use the first set to create a pipeline
      and define data sources, schedules, dependencies, and the transforms to be performed
      on the data. Use the second set in your task runner application to receive the
      next task ready for processing. The logic for performing the task, such as querying
      the data, running data analysis, or converting the data from one format to another,
      is contained within the task runner. The task runner performs the task assigned
      to it by the web service, reporting progress to the web service as it does so.
      When the task is done, the task runner reports the final success or failure
      of the task to the web service.</p>

      own task runner to provide custom data management.</p> <p>AWS Data Pipeline
      implements two main sets of functionality. Use the first set to create a pipeline
      and define data sources, schedules, dependencies, and the transforms to be performed
      on the data. Use the second set in your task runner application to receive the
      next task ready for processing. The logic for performing the task, such as querying
      the data, running data analysis, or converting the data from one format to another,
      is contained within the task runner. The task runner performs the task assigned
      to it by the web service, reporting progress to the web service as it does so.
      When the task is done, the task runner reports the final success or failure
      of the task to the web service.</p>
