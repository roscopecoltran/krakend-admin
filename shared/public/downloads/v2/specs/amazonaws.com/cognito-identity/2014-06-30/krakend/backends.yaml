      provide end-user credentials, first make an unsigned call to <a>GetId</a>. If
      the end user is authenticated with one of the supported identity providers,
      set the <code>Logins</code> map with the identity provider token. <code>GetId</code>
      returns a unique identifier for the user.</p> <p>Next, make an unsigned call
      to <a>GetCredentialsForIdentity</a>. This call expects the same <code>Logins</code>
      map as the <code>GetId</code> call, as well as the <code>IdentityID</code> originally
      returned by <code>GetId</code>. Assuming your identity pool has been configured
      via the <a>SetIdentityPoolRoles</a> operation, <code>GetCredentialsForIdentity</code>
      will return AWS credentials for your use. If your pool has not been configured
      with <code>SetIdentityPoolRoles</code>, or if you want to follow legacy flow,
      make an unsigned call to <a>GetOpenIdToken</a>, which returns the OpenID token
      necessary to call STS and retrieve AWS credentials. This call expects the same
      <code>Logins</code> map as the <code>GetId</code> call, as well as the <code>IdentityID</code>
      originally returned by <code>GetId</code>. The token returned by <code>GetOpenIdToken</code>
      can be passed to the STS operation <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html">AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</a>
      to retrieve AWS credentials.</p> <p>If you want to use Amazon Cognito in an
      Android, iOS, or Unity application, you will probably want to make API calls
      via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/index.html">AWS
      Mobile SDK Developer Guide</a>.</p>
