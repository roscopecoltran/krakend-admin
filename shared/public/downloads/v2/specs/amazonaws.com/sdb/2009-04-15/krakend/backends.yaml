    description: Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions
      of data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and effort
      associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB provides
      developers the freedom to focus on application development. <p> A traditional,
      clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront capital outlay, is
      complex to design, and often requires extensive and repetitive database administration.
      Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically simpler, requiring no schema, automatically
      indexing your data and providing a simple API for storage and access. This approach
      eliminates the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and
      performance tuning. Developers gain access to this functionality within Amazon's
      proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and pay only for
