    description: <fullname>Resource Groups Tagging API</fullname> <p>This guide describes
      the API operations for the resource groups tagging.</p> <p>A tag is a label
      that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag consists of a key and a value, both
      of which you define. For example, if you have two Amazon EC2 instances, you
      might assign both a tag key of "Stack." But the value of "Stack" might be "Testing"
      for one and "Production" for the other.</p> <p>Tagging can help you organize
      your resources and enables you to simplify resource management, access management
      and cost allocation. For more information about tagging, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html">Working
      with Tag Editor</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/resource-groups.html">Working

      <p>Use tag-based filters to search for resources located in the specified region
