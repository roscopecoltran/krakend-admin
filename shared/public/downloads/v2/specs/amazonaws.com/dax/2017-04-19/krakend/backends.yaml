    description: DAX is a managed caching service engineered for Amazon DynamoDB.
      DAX dramatically speeds up database reads by caching frequently-accessed data
      from DynamoDB, so applications can access that data with sub-millisecond latency.
      You can create a DAX cluster easily, using the AWS Management Console. With
      a few simple modifications to your code, your application can begin taking advantage
      of the DAX cluster and realize significant improvements in read performance.
