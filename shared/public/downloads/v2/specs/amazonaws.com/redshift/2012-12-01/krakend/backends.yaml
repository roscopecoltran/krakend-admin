      one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage Amazon
      Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means that
      some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous callback
      handlers, to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the
      parameter descriptions indicate whether a change is applied immediately, on
      the next instance reboot, or during the next maintenance window. For a summary
