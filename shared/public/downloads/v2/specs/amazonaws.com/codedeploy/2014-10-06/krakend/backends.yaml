      of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during

      configuration</b>: A set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure
      conditions used by AWS CodeDeploy during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment</b>:
      The process, and the components involved in the process, of installing content

      An archive file containing source content—source code, web pages, executable
      files, and deployment scripts—along with an application specification file (AppSpec
      file). Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For
      Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and
      its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by
      its commit ID.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This guide also contains information to help

      configuration</b>: A set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure
      conditions used by AWS CodeDeploy during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment</b>:
      The process, and the components involved in the process, of installing content

      An archive file containing source content—source code, web pages, executable
      files, and deployment scripts—along with an application specification file (AppSpec
      file). Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For
      Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and

      variety of application content, such as code, web and configuration files, executables,
      packages, scripts, multimedia files, and so on. AWS CodeDeploy can deploy application

      </p> <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following
      AWS CodeDeploy components:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Application</b>: A name that
      uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. AWS CodeDeploy uses
      this name, which functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination
      of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during
      a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment group</b>: A set of individual
      instances. A deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon
      EC2 instances in Auto Scaling groups, or both. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment
      configuration</b>: A set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure
      conditions used by AWS CodeDeploy during a deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deployment</b>:
      The process, and the components involved in the process, of installing content
      on one or more instances. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Application revisions</b>:
      An archive file containing source content—source code, web pages, executable
      files, and deployment scripts—along with an application specification file (AppSpec
      file). Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For
      Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and
      its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by
      its commit ID.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This guide also contains information to help
      you get details about the instances in your deployments and to make on-premises
      instances available for AWS CodeDeploy deployments.</p> <p> <b>AWS CodeDeploy
