The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size.</p> <note> <p>If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p> <b>Range does not align</b>The byte range value in the request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail. </p> </li> </ul> <p>This operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple times, the data included in the most recent request overwrites the previously uploaded data.</p> <p>An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
