    description: AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect
      location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable.
      One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct
      Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces
      directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
      EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)) and to Amazon Virtual Private
      Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path.
      An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to AWS in the region it is associated
      with, as well as access to other US regions. For example, you can provision
      a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use it
      to access public AWS services in all US Regions and AWS GovCloud (US).

    description: AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect
      location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable.
      One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct
      Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces
      directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
      EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)) and to Amazon Virtual Private
      Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path.
      An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to AWS in the region it is associated
      with, as well as access to other US regions. For example, you can provision
      a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use it
      to access public AWS services in all US Regions and AWS GovCloud (US).
