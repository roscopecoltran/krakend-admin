      Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects by automatically
      identifying servers, virtual machines (VMs), software, and software dependencies
      running in your on-premises data centers. Application Discovery Service also
      collects application performance data, which can help you assess the outcome
      of your migration. The data collected by Application Discovery Service is securely
      retained in an Amazon-hosted and managed database in the cloud. You can export
      the data as a CSV or XML file into your preferred visualization tool or cloud-migration
      solution to plan your migration. For more information, see the Application Discovery
      Service <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">FAQ</a>.</p>
      <p>Application Discovery Service offers two modes of operation.</p> <ul> <li>
      <p> <b>Agentless discovery</b> mode is recommended for environments that use
      VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on
      each host. Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the
      operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises
      infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about
      software and software dependencies. It also doesn't work in non-VMware environments.
      We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments
      and if you want to collect information about software and software dependencies.
      You can also run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless
      discovery to quickly complete the initial infrastructure assessment and then
      install agents on select hosts to gather information about software and software
      dependencies.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Agent-based discovery</b> mode collects
      a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using Amazon software, the
      AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your
      data center. The agent captures infrastructure and application information,
      including an inventory of installed software applications, system and process
      performance, resource utilization, and network dependencies between workloads.
      The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the
      Application Discovery Service database in the cloud. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Application
      Discovery Service integrates with application discovery solutions from AWS Partner
      Network (APN) partners. Third-party application discovery tools can query Application
      Discovery Service and write to the Application Discovery Service database using
      a public API. You can then import the data into either a visualization tool
      or cloud-migration solution.</p> <important> <p>Application Discovery Service
      doesn't gather sensitive information. All data is handled according to the <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">AWS Privacy Policy</a>. You can operate
      Application Discovery Service using offline mode to inspect collected data before
      it is shared with the service.</p> </important> <p>Your AWS account must be
      granted access to Application Discovery Service, a process called <i>whitelisting</i>.
      This is true for AWS partners and customers alike. To request access, sign up

      Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects by automatically
      identifying servers, virtual machines (VMs), software, and software dependencies
      running in your on-premises data centers. Application Discovery Service also
      collects application performance data, which can help you assess the outcome
      of your migration. The data collected by Application Discovery Service is securely
      retained in an Amazon-hosted and managed database in the cloud. You can export
      the data as a CSV or XML file into your preferred visualization tool or cloud-migration
      solution to plan your migration. For more information, see the Application Discovery
      Service <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">FAQ</a>.</p>
      <p>Application Discovery Service offers two modes of operation.</p> <ul> <li>
      <p> <b>Agentless discovery</b> mode is recommended for environments that use
      VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on
      each host. Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the
      operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises
      infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about
      software and software dependencies. It also doesn't work in non-VMware environments.
      We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments
      and if you want to collect information about software and software dependencies.
      You can also run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless
      discovery to quickly complete the initial infrastructure assessment and then
      install agents on select hosts to gather information about software and software
      dependencies.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Agent-based discovery</b> mode collects
      a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using Amazon software, the
      AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your
      data center. The agent captures infrastructure and application information,
      including an inventory of installed software applications, system and process
      performance, resource utilization, and network dependencies between workloads.
      The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the
      Application Discovery Service database in the cloud. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Application
      Discovery Service integrates with application discovery solutions from AWS Partner
      Network (APN) partners. Third-party application discovery tools can query Application
      Discovery Service and write to the Application Discovery Service database using
      a public API. You can then import the data into either a visualization tool
      or cloud-migration solution.</p> <important> <p>Application Discovery Service
      doesn't gather sensitive information. All data is handled according to the <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">AWS Privacy Policy</a>. You can operate
      Application Discovery Service using offline mode to inspect collected data before
      it is shared with the service.</p> </important> <p>Your AWS account must be
      granted access to Application Discovery Service, a process called <i>whitelisting</i>.
      This is true for AWS partners and customers alike. To request access, sign up

      Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects by automatically
      identifying servers, virtual machines (VMs), software, and software dependencies
      running in your on-premises data centers. Application Discovery Service also
      collects application performance data, which can help you assess the outcome
      of your migration. The data collected by Application Discovery Service is securely
      retained in an Amazon-hosted and managed database in the cloud. You can export
      the data as a CSV or XML file into your preferred visualization tool or cloud-migration
      solution to plan your migration. For more information, see the Application Discovery
      Service <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">FAQ</a>.</p>
      <p>Application Discovery Service offers two modes of operation.</p> <ul> <li>
      <p> <b>Agentless discovery</b> mode is recommended for environments that use
      VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on
      each host. Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the
      operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises
      infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about
      software and software dependencies. It also doesn't work in non-VMware environments.
      We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments
      and if you want to collect information about software and software dependencies.
      You can also run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless
      discovery to quickly complete the initial infrastructure assessment and then
      install agents on select hosts to gather information about software and software
      dependencies.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Agent-based discovery</b> mode collects
      a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using Amazon software, the
      AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your
      data center. The agent captures infrastructure and application information,
      including an inventory of installed software applications, system and process
      performance, resource utilization, and network dependencies between workloads.
      The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the
      Application Discovery Service database in the cloud. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Application
      Discovery Service integrates with application discovery solutions from AWS Partner
      Network (APN) partners. Third-party application discovery tools can query Application
      Discovery Service and write to the Application Discovery Service database using
      a public API. You can then import the data into either a visualization tool
      or cloud-migration solution.</p> <important> <p>Application Discovery Service
      doesn't gather sensitive information. All data is handled according to the <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">AWS Privacy Policy</a>. You can operate
      Application Discovery Service using offline mode to inspect collected data before
      it is shared with the service.</p> </important> <p>Your AWS account must be
      granted access to Application Discovery Service, a process called <i>whitelisting</i>.
      This is true for AWS partners and customers alike. To request access, sign up
      for AWS Application Discovery Service <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/preview/">here</a>.
      We send you information about how to get started.</p> <p>This API reference
      provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and

      the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use one

    description: <fullname>AWS Application Discovery Service</fullname> <p>AWS Application
      Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects by automatically
      identifying servers, virtual machines (VMs), software, and software dependencies
      running in your on-premises data centers. Application Discovery Service also
      collects application performance data, which can help you assess the outcome
      of your migration. The data collected by Application Discovery Service is securely
      retained in an Amazon-hosted and managed database in the cloud. You can export
      the data as a CSV or XML file into your preferred visualization tool or cloud-migration
      solution to plan your migration. For more information, see the Application Discovery
      Service <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">FAQ</a>.</p>
      <p>Application Discovery Service offers two modes of operation.</p> <ul> <li>
      <p> <b>Agentless discovery</b> mode is recommended for environments that use
      VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on
      each host. Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the
      operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises
      infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about
      software and software dependencies. It also doesn't work in non-VMware environments.
      We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments
      and if you want to collect information about software and software dependencies.
      You can also run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless
      discovery to quickly complete the initial infrastructure assessment and then
      install agents on select hosts to gather information about software and software
      dependencies.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Agent-based discovery</b> mode collects
      a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using Amazon software, the
      AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your
      data center. The agent captures infrastructure and application information,
      including an inventory of installed software applications, system and process
      performance, resource utilization, and network dependencies between workloads.
      The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the
      Application Discovery Service database in the cloud. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Application
      Discovery Service integrates with application discovery solutions from AWS Partner
      Network (APN) partners. Third-party application discovery tools can query Application
      Discovery Service and write to the Application Discovery Service database using
      a public API. You can then import the data into either a visualization tool
      or cloud-migration solution.</p> <important> <p>Application Discovery Service
      doesn't gather sensitive information. All data is handled according to the <a
      href="http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">AWS Privacy Policy</a>. You can operate
      Application Discovery Service using offline mode to inspect collected data before
      it is shared with the service.</p> </important> <p>Your AWS account must be
      granted access to Application Discovery Service, a process called <i>whitelisting</i>.
      This is true for AWS partners and customers alike. To request access, sign up
