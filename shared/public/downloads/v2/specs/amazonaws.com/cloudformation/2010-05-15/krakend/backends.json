You can use AWS CloudFormation to leverage AWS products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWith AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor more information about AWS CloudFormation, see the \u003ca href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\"\u003eAWS CloudFormation Product Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAmazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products.
