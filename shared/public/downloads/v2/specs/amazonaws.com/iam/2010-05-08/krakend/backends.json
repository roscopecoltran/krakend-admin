The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM and AWS. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the \u003ca href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\"\u003eTools for Amazon Web Services\u003c/a\u003e page. \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/note\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to IAM. However, you can also use the IAM Query API to make direct calls to the IAM web service.

IAM supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003cb\u003eSigning Requests\u003c/b\u003e \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRequests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key.
