      </p> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>The AWS Security Token Service (STS) has a
      default endpoint of https://sts.amazonaws.com that maps to the US East (N. Virginia)
      region. Additional regions are available and are activated by default. For more
      information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html">Activating
      and Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
      <p>For information about STS endpoints, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region">Regions
      and Endpoints</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <b>Recording
      API requests</b> </p> <p>STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that
      records AWS calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3
      bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what
      requests were successfully made to STS, who made the request, when it was made,
      and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find
      your log files, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">AWS
      CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p>
