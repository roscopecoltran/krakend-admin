      tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of
      request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity
      without downtime or performance degradation, and use the AWS Management Console

      spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers
      to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent

      and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS region,
      providing built-in high availability and data durability. </p>
