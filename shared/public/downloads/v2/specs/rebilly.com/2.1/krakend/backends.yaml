      # Introduction
      The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
      resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
      accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
      HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
      you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
      and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

      # Authentication
      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      # Introduction
      The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
      resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
      accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
      HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
      you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
      and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

      # Authentication
      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      # Introduction
      The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
      resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
      accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
      HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
      you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
      and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

      # Authentication
      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      # Introduction
      The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
      resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
      accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
      HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
      you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
      and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

      # Authentication
      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      # Introduction
      The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
      resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
      accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
      HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
      you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
      and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

      # Authentication
      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      # Introduction
      The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
      resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
      accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
      HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
      you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
      and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

      # Authentication
      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      # Introduction
      The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
      resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
      accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
      HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
      you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
      and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

      # Authentication
      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      # Introduction
      The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
      resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
      accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
      HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
      you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
      and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

      # Authentication
      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      For all PHP SDK examples provided in this spec you will need to configure `$client`.
      You may do it like this:

      HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
      you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
      and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

      # Authentication
      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      # Introduction
      The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
      resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
      accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
      HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
      you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
      and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

      # Authentication
      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
      accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
      HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
      you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
      and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

      # Authentication
      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.

      # Introduction
      The Rebilly API is built on HTTP.  Our API is RESTful.  It has predictable
      resource URLs.  It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors.  It also
      accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.  You can use your favorite
      HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Rebilly's API, or
      you can use one of our SDKs (currently available in [PHP](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-php)
      and [C#](https://github.com/Rebilly/rebilly-dotnet-client)).

      # Authentication
      When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key.
      You can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
      need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the
      Rebilly API by providing your secret key in the request header.

      Rebilly offers three forms of authentication:  private key, JSON Web Tokens, and
      public key.
      - private key: authenticates each request by searching for the presence
      of an HTTP header: REB-APIKEY.
      - JWT: authenticates each request by the HTTP header: Authorization.
      - public key: authenticates by the HTTP header: REB-AUTH (read more on this below).

      Rebilly also offers JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, where you can control
      the specific granular permissions and expiration for that JWT.  We call our resource
      for generating JWT [Sessions](#tag/Sessions).

      Rebilly also has a client-side authentication scheme that uses an
      apiUser and HMAC-SHA1 signature (only for the Tokens resource), so
      that you may safely create tokens from the client-side without compromising
      your secret keys.

      Never share your secret keys. Keep them guarded and secure.
      The client-side authentication scheme uses one HTTP header named REB-AUTH.
