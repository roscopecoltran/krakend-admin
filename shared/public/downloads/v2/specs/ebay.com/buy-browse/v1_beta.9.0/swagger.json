There are differences between how legacy APIs and RESTful APIs return the identifier of an &quot;item&quot;. There is also a difference in what the item Id represents and in the format of the item Id value returned. This call lets you use the legacy item Ids retrieve the details of a specific item, such as description, price, and other information the buyer needs to make a purchasing decision. It also returns the RESTful item Id, which you can use with all the Buy API calls. For more information about how to use legacy Ids with the Buy APIs, see Legacy API compatibility in the Buying Integration guide. This call returns the item details, so it requires you pass in either the item Id of a non-variation item or the item Ids of both the parent and child of a item group (item with variations). Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this call. If you are an eBay Network Partner you must use affiliateCampaignId=ePNCampaignId,affiliateReferenceId=referenceId in the header in order to be paid for selling eBay items on your site and it is strongly recommended you use contextualLocation to improved the estimated delivery window information.

Valid values: COMPACT - This returns the following fields, which let you quickly check if the availability or price of the item has changed, if the item has been revised by the seller, or if an item's top-rated plus status has changed for items you have stored. itemId - The identifier of the item. sellerItemRevision - An identifier generated/incremented when a seller revises the item. There are two types of item revisions; seller changes, such as changing the title, and eBay system changes, such as changing the quantity when an item is purchased. This Id is changed only when the seller makes a change to the item. This means you cannot use this value to determine if the quantity has changed. topRatedBuyingExperience - A boolean value indicating if this item is a top-rated plus item. A change in the item's top rated plus standing is not tracked by the revision Id. See topRatedBuyingExperience for more information. price - This is tracked by the revision Id but is returned here to enable you to quickly verify the price of the item. estimatedAvailabilities - Returns the item availability information, which is based on the item's quantity. Changes in quantity are not tracked by the revision Id. For Example To check if a stored item's information is current, do following. Pass in the item Id and set fieldgroups to COMPACT. item/v1|46566502948|0?fieldgroups=COMPACT Do one of the following: If the sellerItemRevision field is returned and you haven't stored a revision number for this item, record the number and pass in the item Id in the getItem call to get the latest information. If the revision number is different from the value you have stored, update the value and pass in the item Id in the getItem call to get the latest information.

In addition to returning items, which is the default, you can return refinements (metadata) about an item that enables you to create aspect histograms. A histogram enables users to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results. You can return: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - Lets shoppers refine the result set by variation aspects, such as Brand, Color, etc. BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENT - Lets shoppers refine the result set by either FIXED_PRICE or AUCTION CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - Lets shoppers refine the result set by items in a category CONDITION_REFINEMENT - Lets shoppers refine the result set by item condition, such as NEW, USED, etc. MATCHING_ITEMS - The default, which returns the items. When used with one or more of the refinement values above the specified refinements and all the matching items are returned. FULL - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items. Filtering by aspects You can use the aspect refinements returned to filter the result set using the aspect_filter field. For example: This call gets a list of the aspects pairs for the item and the dominant category (category most of the items are in). /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS This call filters the items by one of the aspect pairs returned and the dominant category ( categoryId is required when using aspect_filter) /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{adidas} This call filters the items by multiple aspects /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{adidas},Featured Refinements:{Adidas Match Ball} This call filters the items by multiple aspect values /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{Nike|Wilson} Additional filters There are also multiple filters you can use to refine the result set, such as listing format, item condition, price range, UPC value, listing end date, location, and more. You can use multiple filters in a single call. For a list and details of the supported filters, see search Call Field Filters.
