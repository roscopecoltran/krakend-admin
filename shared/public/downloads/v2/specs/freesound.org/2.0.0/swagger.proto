    // This parameter represents a boolean option to indicate whether to collapse results belonging to sounds of the same pack into single entries in the results list. If `group_by_pack=1` and search results contain more than one sound that belongs to the same pack, only one sound for each distinct pack is returned (sounds with no packs are returned as well). However, the returned sound will feature two extra properties to access these other sounds omitted from the results list: `n_from_same_pack`: indicates how many other results belong to the same pack (and have not been returned) `more_from_same_pack`: uri pointing to the list of omitted sound results of the same pack (also including the result which has already been returned). See examples below. By default `group_by_pack=0`.
    int32 group_by_pack = 2;
    // Query results are paginated, this parameter indicates what page should be returned. By default `page=1`.
    int32 page = 3;
    // Indicates the number of sounds per page to include in the result. By default `page_size=15`, and the maximum is `page_size=150`. Not that with bigger `page_size`, more data will need to be transferred.

    // The query! The query is the main parameter used to define a query. You can type several terms separated by spaces or phrases wrapped inside quote ‘”’ characters. For every term, you can also use ‘+’ and ‘-‘ modifier characters to indicate that a term is “mandatory” or “prohibited” (by default, terms are considered to be “mandatory”). For example, in a query such as query=term_a -term_b, sounds including term_b will not match the search criteria. The query does a weighted search over some sound properties including sound tags, the sound name, its description, pack name and the sound id. Therefore, searching for query=123 will find you sounds with id 1234, sounds that have 1234 in the description, in the tags, etc. You’ll find some examples below. Using an empty query (query= or query="") will return all Freeosund sounds.
