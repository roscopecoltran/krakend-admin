    description: Transit API can be used to obtain time-aggregated data representing
      moving the people between various spatial points within the Czech republic.
      Having A - 'from' and B - 'to' points, the API can return count of people traveling
      from A to B or people that are from A and traveling to B, etc. The mobility
      data is based on moving mobile stations in O2 mobile network.
