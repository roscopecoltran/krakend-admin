    description: "Containers are virtual software objects that include all the elements
      that an app needs to run. A container has the benefits of resource isolation
      and allocation but is more portable and efficient than, for example, a virtual
      machine.\n\n This documentation describes the IBM Containers API, which is based
      on the Docker Remote API. The API provides endpoints that you can use to create
      and manage your single containers and container groups in Bluemix. Endpoints
      are summarized under the following tags: \n\n- **Authentication**: Retrieve
      and refresh your TLS certificates. \n- **Private Docker images registry**: Create
      your own private Docker images registry in Bluemix by setting a namespace for
      your organization. \n- **Images**: View, build, and push your images to your
      private Bluemix registry so you can use them with IBM Containers. You can also
      scan your container images with the Vulnerability Advisor against standard policies
      set by the organization manager and a database of known Ubuntu issues. \n- **Single
      Containers**: Create and manage single containers in Bluemix. Use a single container
      to implement short-lived processes or to run simple tests as you develop an
      app or service. To make your single container available from the internet, review
      the `Public IP addresses` endpoints. \n- **Container Groups**: Create and manage
      your container groups in Bluemix. A container group consists of multiple single
      containers that are all created from the same container image and as a consequence
      are configured in the same way. Container groups offer further options at no
      cost to make your app highly available. These options include in-built load
      balancing, auto-recovery of unhealthy container instances, and auto-scaling
      of container instances based on CPU and memory usage. Map a public route to
      your container group to make your app accessible from the internet.  \n- **Public
      IP addresses**: Use these endpoints to request public IP addresses for your
      space. You can bind this IP address to your container to make your container
      accessible from the internet. \n- **File shares**: Create, list and delete file
      shares in a space. A file share is a NFS storage system that hosts Docker volumes.
      \ \n- **Volumes**: Create and manage container volumes in your space to persist
      the data of your containers.  \n\n\n Each API request requires an HTTP header
      that includes the 'X-Auth-Token’ and 'X-Auth-Project-Id’ parameter. \n\n- **X-Auth-Token**:
      The JSON web token (JWT) that you receive when logging into the Bluemix platform.
      It allows you to use the IBM Containers REST API, access services, and resources.
      Run `cf oauth-token` to retrieve your access token information.\n- **X-Auth-Project-Id**:
      The unique ID of your organization space where you want to create or work with
      your containers. Run `cf space <space_name> --guid`, where `<space_name>` is
      the name of your space, to retrieve your space ID.\n\n\n For further information
      about how containers work in the IBM Containers service, review the documentation
      under https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html. "

    description: "Containers are virtual software objects that include all the elements
      that an app needs to run. A container has the benefits of resource isolation
      and allocation but is more portable and efficient than, for example, a virtual
      machine.\n\n This documentation describes the IBM Containers API, which is based
      on the Docker Remote API. The API provides endpoints that you can use to create
      and manage your single containers and container groups in Bluemix. Endpoints
      are summarized under the following tags: \n\n- **Authentication**: Retrieve
      and refresh your TLS certificates. \n- **Private Docker images registry**: Create
      your own private Docker images registry in Bluemix by setting a namespace for
      your organization. \n- **Images**: View, build, and push your images to your
      private Bluemix registry so you can use them with IBM Containers. You can also
      scan your container images with the Vulnerability Advisor against standard policies
      set by the organization manager and a database of known Ubuntu issues. \n- **Single
      Containers**: Create and manage single containers in Bluemix. Use a single container
      to implement short-lived processes or to run simple tests as you develop an
      app or service. To make your single container available from the internet, review
      the `Public IP addresses` endpoints. \n- **Container Groups**: Create and manage
      your container groups in Bluemix. A container group consists of multiple single
      containers that are all created from the same container image and as a consequence
      are configured in the same way. Container groups offer further options at no
      cost to make your app highly available. These options include in-built load
      balancing, auto-recovery of unhealthy container instances, and auto-scaling
      of container instances based on CPU and memory usage. Map a public route to
      your container group to make your app accessible from the internet.  \n- **Public
      IP addresses**: Use these endpoints to request public IP addresses for your
      space. You can bind this IP address to your container to make your container
      accessible from the internet. \n- **File shares**: Create, list and delete file
      shares in a space. A file share is a NFS storage system that hosts Docker volumes.
      \ \n- **Volumes**: Create and manage container volumes in your space to persist
      the data of your containers.  \n\n\n Each API request requires an HTTP header
      that includes the 'X-Auth-Token’ and 'X-Auth-Project-Id’ parameter. \n\n- **X-Auth-Token**:
      The JSON web token (JWT) that you receive when logging into the Bluemix platform.
      It allows you to use the IBM Containers REST API, access services, and resources.
      Run `cf oauth-token` to retrieve your access token information.\n- **X-Auth-Project-Id**:
      The unique ID of your organization space where you want to create or work with
      your containers. Run `cf space <space_name> --guid`, where `<space_name>` is
      the name of your space, to retrieve your space ID.\n\n\n For further information
      about how containers work in the IBM Containers service, review the documentation
      under https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html. "

    description: "Containers are virtual software objects that include all the elements
      that an app needs to run. A container has the benefits of resource isolation
      and allocation but is more portable and efficient than, for example, a virtual
      machine.\n\n This documentation describes the IBM Containers API, which is based
      on the Docker Remote API. The API provides endpoints that you can use to create
      and manage your single containers and container groups in Bluemix. Endpoints
      are summarized under the following tags: \n\n- **Authentication**: Retrieve
      and refresh your TLS certificates. \n- **Private Docker images registry**: Create
      your own private Docker images registry in Bluemix by setting a namespace for
      your organization. \n- **Images**: View, build, and push your images to your
      private Bluemix registry so you can use them with IBM Containers. You can also
      scan your container images with the Vulnerability Advisor against standard policies
      set by the organization manager and a database of known Ubuntu issues. \n- **Single
      Containers**: Create and manage single containers in Bluemix. Use a single container
      to implement short-lived processes or to run simple tests as you develop an
      app or service. To make your single container available from the internet, review
      the `Public IP addresses` endpoints. \n- **Container Groups**: Create and manage
      your container groups in Bluemix. A container group consists of multiple single
      containers that are all created from the same container image and as a consequence
      are configured in the same way. Container groups offer further options at no
      cost to make your app highly available. These options include in-built load
      balancing, auto-recovery of unhealthy container instances, and auto-scaling
      of container instances based on CPU and memory usage. Map a public route to
      your container group to make your app accessible from the internet.  \n- **Public
      IP addresses**: Use these endpoints to request public IP addresses for your
      space. You can bind this IP address to your container to make your container
      accessible from the internet. \n- **File shares**: Create, list and delete file
      shares in a space. A file share is a NFS storage system that hosts Docker volumes.
      \ \n- **Volumes**: Create and manage container volumes in your space to persist
      the data of your containers.  \n\n\n Each API request requires an HTTP header
      that includes the 'X-Auth-Token’ and 'X-Auth-Project-Id’ parameter. \n\n- **X-Auth-Token**:
      The JSON web token (JWT) that you receive when logging into the Bluemix platform.
      It allows you to use the IBM Containers REST API, access services, and resources.
      Run `cf oauth-token` to retrieve your access token information.\n- **X-Auth-Project-Id**:
      The unique ID of your organization space where you want to create or work with
      your containers. Run `cf space <space_name> --guid`, where `<space_name>` is
      the name of your space, to retrieve your space ID.\n\n\n For further information
      about how containers work in the IBM Containers service, review the documentation
      under https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html. "

    description: "Containers are virtual software objects that include all the elements
      that an app needs to run. A container has the benefits of resource isolation
      and allocation but is more portable and efficient than, for example, a virtual
      machine.\n\n This documentation describes the IBM Containers API, which is based
      on the Docker Remote API. The API provides endpoints that you can use to create
      and manage your single containers and container groups in Bluemix. Endpoints
      are summarized under the following tags: \n\n- **Authentication**: Retrieve
      and refresh your TLS certificates. \n- **Private Docker images registry**: Create
      your own private Docker images registry in Bluemix by setting a namespace for
      your organization. \n- **Images**: View, build, and push your images to your
      private Bluemix registry so you can use them with IBM Containers. You can also
      scan your container images with the Vulnerability Advisor against standard policies
      set by the organization manager and a database of known Ubuntu issues. \n- **Single
      Containers**: Create and manage single containers in Bluemix. Use a single container
      to implement short-lived processes or to run simple tests as you develop an
      app or service. To make your single container available from the internet, review
      the `Public IP addresses` endpoints. \n- **Container Groups**: Create and manage
      your container groups in Bluemix. A container group consists of multiple single
      containers that are all created from the same container image and as a consequence
      are configured in the same way. Container groups offer further options at no
      cost to make your app highly available. These options include in-built load
      balancing, auto-recovery of unhealthy container instances, and auto-scaling
      of container instances based on CPU and memory usage. Map a public route to
      your container group to make your app accessible from the internet.  \n- **Public
      IP addresses**: Use these endpoints to request public IP addresses for your
      space. You can bind this IP address to your container to make your container
      accessible from the internet. \n- **File shares**: Create, list and delete file

    description: "Containers are virtual software objects that include all the elements
      that an app needs to run. A container has the benefits of resource isolation
      and allocation but is more portable and efficient than, for example, a virtual
      machine.\n\n This documentation describes the IBM Containers API, which is based
      on the Docker Remote API. The API provides endpoints that you can use to create
      and manage your single containers and container groups in Bluemix. Endpoints
      are summarized under the following tags: \n\n- **Authentication**: Retrieve
      and refresh your TLS certificates. \n- **Private Docker images registry**: Create
      your own private Docker images registry in Bluemix by setting a namespace for
      your organization. \n- **Images**: View, build, and push your images to your
      private Bluemix registry so you can use them with IBM Containers. You can also
      scan your container images with the Vulnerability Advisor against standard policies
      set by the organization manager and a database of known Ubuntu issues. \n- **Single
      Containers**: Create and manage single containers in Bluemix. Use a single container
      to implement short-lived processes or to run simple tests as you develop an
      app or service. To make your single container available from the internet, review
      the `Public IP addresses` endpoints. \n- **Container Groups**: Create and manage
      your container groups in Bluemix. A container group consists of multiple single
      containers that are all created from the same container image and as a consequence
      are configured in the same way. Container groups offer further options at no
      cost to make your app highly available. These options include in-built load
      balancing, auto-recovery of unhealthy container instances, and auto-scaling
      of container instances based on CPU and memory usage. Map a public route to
      your container group to make your app accessible from the internet.  \n- **Public
      IP addresses**: Use these endpoints to request public IP addresses for your
      space. You can bind this IP address to your container to make your container
      accessible from the internet. \n- **File shares**: Create, list and delete file
      shares in a space. A file share is a NFS storage system that hosts Docker volumes.
      \ \n- **Volumes**: Create and manage container volumes in your space to persist
      the data of your containers.  \n\n\n Each API request requires an HTTP header
      that includes the 'X-Auth-Token’ and 'X-Auth-Project-Id’ parameter. \n\n- **X-Auth-Token**:
      The JSON web token (JWT) that you receive when logging into the Bluemix platform.
      It allows you to use the IBM Containers REST API, access services, and resources.
      Run `cf oauth-token` to retrieve your access token information.\n- **X-Auth-Project-Id**:
      The unique ID of your organization space where you want to create or work with
      your containers. Run `cf space <space_name> --guid`, where `<space_name>` is
      the name of your space, to retrieve your space ID.\n\n\n For further information
      about how containers work in the IBM Containers service, review the documentation
      under https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html. "

    description: "Containers are virtual software objects that include all the elements
      that an app needs to run. A container has the benefits of resource isolation
      and allocation but is more portable and efficient than, for example, a virtual
      machine.\n\n This documentation describes the IBM Containers API, which is based
      on the Docker Remote API. The API provides endpoints that you can use to create
      and manage your single containers and container groups in Bluemix. Endpoints
      are summarized under the following tags: \n\n- **Authentication**: Retrieve
      and refresh your TLS certificates. \n- **Private Docker images registry**: Create
      your own private Docker images registry in Bluemix by setting a namespace for
      your organization. \n- **Images**: View, build, and push your images to your
      private Bluemix registry so you can use them with IBM Containers. You can also
      scan your container images with the Vulnerability Advisor against standard policies
      set by the organization manager and a database of known Ubuntu issues. \n- **Single
      Containers**: Create and manage single containers in Bluemix. Use a single container
      to implement short-lived processes or to run simple tests as you develop an
      app or service. To make your single container available from the internet, review
      the `Public IP addresses` endpoints. \n- **Container Groups**: Create and manage
      your container groups in Bluemix. A container group consists of multiple single
      containers that are all created from the same container image and as a consequence
      are configured in the same way. Container groups offer further options at no
      cost to make your app highly available. These options include in-built load
      balancing, auto-recovery of unhealthy container instances, and auto-scaling
      of container instances based on CPU and memory usage. Map a public route to
      your container group to make your app accessible from the internet.  \n- **Public
      IP addresses**: Use these endpoints to request public IP addresses for your
      space. You can bind this IP address to your container to make your container
      accessible from the internet. \n- **File shares**: Create, list and delete file
      shares in a space. A file share is a NFS storage system that hosts Docker volumes.
      \ \n- **Volumes**: Create and manage container volumes in your space to persist
      the data of your containers.  \n\n\n Each API request requires an HTTP header
      that includes the 'X-Auth-Token’ and 'X-Auth-Project-Id’ parameter. \n\n- **X-Auth-Token**:
      The JSON web token (JWT) that you receive when logging into the Bluemix platform.
      It allows you to use the IBM Containers REST API, access services, and resources.
      Run `cf oauth-token` to retrieve your access token information.\n- **X-Auth-Project-Id**:
      The unique ID of your organization space where you want to create or work with
      your containers. Run `cf space <space_name> --guid`, where `<space_name>` is
      the name of your space, to retrieve your space ID.\n\n\n For further information
      about how containers work in the IBM Containers service, review the documentation
      under https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html. "
