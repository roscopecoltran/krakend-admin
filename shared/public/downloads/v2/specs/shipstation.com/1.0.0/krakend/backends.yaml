    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |
      Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.\n``429``
      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration

      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please

      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,

      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |
      Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.\n``429``
      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)

      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |
      Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.\n``429``
      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |
      Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.\n``429``
      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is

      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |
      Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.\n``429``
      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |
      Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.\n``429``
      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |

      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an

      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this

      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |
      Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.\n``429``
      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is

      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden

      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |
      Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.\n``429``
      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was

      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |
      Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.\n``429``
      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |
      Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.\n``429``
      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |
      Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.\n``429``
      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in

      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was
      successful and a resource was created.\n``204`` | No Content - The request was
      successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is
      empty).\n``400`` | Bad Request -  The request could not be understood or was
      missing required parameters.\n``401`` | Unauthorized -  Authentication failed
      or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.\n``403`` | Forbidden
      - Access denied.\n``404`` | Not Found -  Resource was not found.\n``405`` |
      Method Not Allowed -  Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.\n``429``
      | Too Many Requests - Exceeded ShipStation API limits. When the limit is reached,
      your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset seconds
      have elapsed.\n``500`` | Internal Server Error - ShipStation has encountered
      an error.\n\n## DateTime Format and Time Zone\n\nShipStation uses the ISO 8601
      combined format for dateTime stamps being submitted to and returned from the
      API. Please be sure to submit all dateTime values as follows:\n\nyyyy-mm-dd
      hh:mm:ss (24 hour notation). Example - ``2016-11-29 23:59:59``\n\nThe time zone
      represented in all API responses is PST/PDT. Similarly, ShipStation asks that
      you make all time zone convertions and submit any dateTime requests in PST/PDT."

      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
      email us at <apisupport@shipstation.com>\n\n## Server Responses\n\nStatus Code
      | Description\n------------|-------------\n``200`` | OK - The request was successful
      (some API calls may return 201 instead).\n``201`` | Created - The request was

    description: "# Integrating with ShipStation\n\nShipStation strives to streamline
      shipping for online sellers, no matter where they sell their products online.
      We are continuously adding new marketplaces, shopping carts, and integration
      tools, because we know the e-commerce space is growing. \nAs a result, we’ve
      worked hard to provide developer resources to build custom integrations with
      ShipStation.  If you’re interested in becoming a partner of ours, drop us a
      line by [filling out this form](http://www.shipstation.com/partners/shipstation-api-custom-store/)
      and we’ll get in touch.\n\nThere are two methods to integrate with ShipStation:\n\n*
      Custom Store Integration\n\n* ShipStation API\n\n## Custom Store Integration\n\nLooking
      for a more 1-to-1 relationship between ShipStation and your chosen selling platform?
      The Custom Store Integration is the ticket. Our custom store integration is
      just like any of our other selling channel integration, and could be eligible
      (based on internal review) as a branded option within the ShipStation admin.
      It also allows the user to sync orders within ShipStation in a single click,
      in addition to ShipStation automatically sending shipment status and tracking
      information \nupdates back to your cart or marketplace once a label is created.
      It’s the best way to sync up orders with ShipStation and have the most seamless
      experience.\n\nThe Custom Store allows you to perform two major functions:\n\n*
      Provide order information to ShipStation, including recipient address, products,
      customers, etc.\n\n* Receive tracking information when an order is shipped,
      including shipping method, shipping status, tracking number, and more\n\nTo
      integrate with the Custom Store, you must expose a web page that renders XML
      that adheres to the specification defined in the Custom Store Integration Guide.
      \nWe refer to this page as your “XML Endpoint”. If you can provide us an XML
      Endpoint, we can *pull* data from your endpoint just like we do with other marketplaces
      like eBay and Amazon.\n\n**To find out more about our Custom Store Integration,
      click here: [Custom Store Integration Guide](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478)**\n\n##
      ShipStation API\n\nOur API is available for any plan, and allows for read access
      to almost all data in your account, and write access to create specific objects,
      like Orders, Customers, and Products. \nThe API is a great way to get data directly
      to and from ShipStation, like creating products, customers, and querying order
      & shipping data. Please note that an API integration will not allow you to use
      your own MarketplaceID that could eventually be branded with your company's
      logo (see the Custom Store Integration above for that functionality).\n\n**This
      API allows developers to build applications that interface with the ShipStation
      platform. The API can be used to automate many tasks including:**\n\n+ Managing
      Orders\n\n+ Managing Shipments\n\n+ Creating Shipping Labels\n\n+ Retrieving
      Shipping Rates\n\n+ and more!!!\n\n**To learn more about our API, please review
      our API documentation below.**\n\n## Which one should I pick?\n\nThe method
      that's right for your integration very much depends on the type of integration
      you're planning on implementing. A Custom Store allows ShipStation to *pull*
      order information from your platform the very same way we *pull* data from marketplaces
      such as eBay, Amazon, and Shopify. Once an order has been shipped in ShipStation,
      ShipStation automatically *pushes* tracking information back to your custom
      store. Though the functionality afforded by this approach is limited to these
      2 main functions, much of the *heavy lifting* is performed by ShipStation. Importing
      orders \nand sending tracking information is performed automatically by ShipStation,
      as long as your XML endpoint is available to receive our data.\n\nAn API integration,
      on the other hand, exposes much more functionality, but requires that the developer
      do much of the heavy lifting. Orders must be *pushed* to ShipStation by using
      our \"/orders/CreateOrder\" endpoint.  The API allows developers to perform
      functions such as tagging an order, \nshipping an order, creating a shipping
      label (without an order), retrieving shipping rates, adding funds to a carrier
      account, creating a warehouse, listing products, and much more.  The functionality
      the API affords are typical actions that a user would perform if using the web
      app.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* **Will your integration be the main order management
      tool for the online seller?**  If so, the API's broader range of functionality
      may be the best option.\n\n* **Would you like your store integration to be a
      branded marketplace within the ShipStation admin?** When you integrate using
      the Custom Store Integration, you could be eligible to have your company branded
      within the ShipStation admin. A branded store could have the plugin's logo in
      the app,\nas well as an easier store setup, order sync, and reporting. Please
      note, ShipStation makes the final decision, based on integration and partner
      requirements, on which custom stores are branded within our application.\n\n#
      ShipStation API Requirements\n\n## End Point\n\nEndpoints are located at the
      following domain https://ssapi.shipstation.com/ and will need to have a specific
      reference added to return data. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot access this URL directly
      and must reference one of the specific endpoints below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe
      ShipStation API uses [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
      Use your ShipStation ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` as the password.
      \ You can find your ``API Key`` as the username and ``API Secret`` under Settings
      at https://ss.shipstation.com/#/settings/api .\n\nThe Authorization header is
      constructed as follows:\n\n+ Username (``API KEY``) and password (``API Secret``)
      are combined into a string \"username:password\"\n\n+ The resulting string is
      then encoded using the RFC2045-MIME variant of Base64, except not limited to
      76 char/line\n\n+ The authorization method and a space i.e. \"Basic \" is then
      put before the encoded string.\n\nFor example, if the ``API KEY`` given is 'ShipStation'
      and the ``API Secret`` is 'Rocks' then the header is formed as follows:\n\n+
      Authorization: Basic U2hpcFN0YXRpb246Um9ja3M=\n\n## API Rate Limits\n\nIn an
      effort to ensure consistent application performance and increased scalability,
      we have implemented rate limiting on the ShipStation API.  Your integration
      will need to be able to handle HTTP rate limiting status messages as defined
      below:\n\n**Response Headers**\n\nAll responses will include headers with status
      information about rate limiting.\n\n1. X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the maximum number
      of requests per minute to the endpoint\n\n2. X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the available
      requests remaining in the current window\n\n3. X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the number
      of seconds remaining until the next window begins\n\n**Hitting the Limit**\n\nIf
      your application hits the rate limit, an HTTP 429 will be returned with this
      body:\n\n```\n{\n    \"message\": \"Too Many Requests\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd these
      headers, assuming it is 40 seconds into the current window:\n\n```\n{\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Limit\":
      60,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Remaining\": 0,\n    \"X-Rate-Limit-Reset\": 20\n}\n```\n\nWhen
      the limit is reached, your application should stop making requests until X-Rate-Limit-Reset
      seconds have elapsed. The current Rate limit for each set of the API Key and
      Secret is 40 requests per minute.\n\nIf you have any issues with the API, please
