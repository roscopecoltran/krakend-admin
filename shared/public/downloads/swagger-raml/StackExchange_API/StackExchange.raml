                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            Returns all users on a site.
             
            This method returns a list of users.
             
            The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the user object:
             - reputation - reputation
             - creation - creation_date
             - name - display_name
             - modified - last_modified_date
              reputation is the default sort.
             
             It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
             
            The inname parameter lets consumers filter the results down to just those users with a certain substring in their display name. For example, inname=kevin will return all users with both users named simply "Kevin" or those with Kevin as one of (or part of) their names; such as "Kevin Montrose".

                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the user object:
                 - reputation - reputation
                 - creation - creation_date
                 - name - display_name
                 - modified - last_modified_date
                  reputation is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

                    Returns those users on a site who both have moderator powers, and were actually elected.
                     
                    This method excludes Stack Exchange Inc. employees, unless they were actually elected moderators on a site (which can only have happened prior to their employment).
                     
                    The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the user object:
                     - reputation - reputation
                     - creation - creation_date
                     - name - display_name
                     - modified - last_modified_date
                      reputation is the default sort.
                     
                     It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                     
                    This method returns a list of users.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                Gets the users identified in ids in {ids}.
                 
                Typically this method will be called to fetch user profiles when you have obtained user ids from some other source, such as /questions.
                 
                {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.
                 
                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the user object:
                 - reputation - reputation
                 - creation - creation_date
                 - name - display_name
                 - modified - last_modified_date
                  reputation is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                 
                This method returns a list of users.

                    description: |
                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.
                     
                    The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the answer object:
                     - activity - last_activity_date
                     - creation - creation_date
                     - votes - score
                      activity is the default sort.
                     
                     It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                     
                    This method returns a list of answers.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.
                     
                    The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the suggested_edit object:
                     - creation - creation_date
                     - approval - approval_date Does not return unapproved suggested_edits
                     - rejection - rejection_date Does not return unrejected suggested_edits
                      creation is the default sort.
                     
                     It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty

These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth.

                        Questions returned by this method have answers, but the owner has not opted to accept any of them.
                         
                        {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.
                         
                        The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
                         - activity - last_activity_date
                         - creation - creation_date
                         - votes - score
                          activity is the default sort.
                         
                         It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

                                The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                                
                                An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                                
                                Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                                
                                The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                                
                                #Safety
                                
                                Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                                
                                Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                                
                                When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                                
                                #Built In Filters
                                
                                The following filters are built in:
                                
                                default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                                withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                                none, which is empty
                                total, which includes just .total
                                
                                #Compatibility with V1.x
                                
                                For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        Gets the questions asked by the users in {ids} which the site consideres unanswered, while still having at least one answer posted.
                         
                        These rules are subject to change, but currently any question without at least one upvoted or accepted answer is considered unanswered.
                         
                        To get the set of questions that a user probably considers unanswered, the returned questions should be unioned with those returned by /users/{id}/questions/no-answers. These methods are distinct so that truly unanswered (that is, zero posted answers) questions can be easily separated from mearly poorly or inadequately answered ones.
                         
                        {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.
                         
                        The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
                         - activity - last_activity_date
                         - creation - creation_date
                         - votes - score
                          activity is the default sort.
                         
                         It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                         
                        This method returns a list of questions.

                                The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                                
                                An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                                
                                Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                                
                                The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                                
                                #Safety
                                
                                Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                                
                                Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                                
                                When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                                
                                #Built In Filters
                                
                                The following filters are built in:
                                
                                default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                                withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                                none, which is empty
                                total, which includes just .total
                                
                                #Compatibility with V1.x
                                
                                For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                                The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                                
                                An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                                
                                Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                                
                                The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                                
                                #Safety
                                
                                Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                                
                                Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                                
                                When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                                
                                #Built In Filters
                                
                                The following filters are built in:
                                
                                default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                                withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                                none, which is empty
                                total, which includes just .total
                                
                                #Compatibility with V1.x
                                
                                For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        Questions returns by this method actually have zero undeleted answers. It is completely disjoint /users/{ids}/questions/unanswered and /users/{ids}/questions/unaccepted, which only return questions with at least one answer, subject to other contraints.
                         
                        {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.
                         
                        The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
                         - activity - last_activity_date
                         - creation - creation_date
                         - votes - score
                          activity is the default sort.
                         
                         It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                         
                        This method returns a list of questions.

                                The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                                
                                An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                                
                                Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                                
                                The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                                
                                #Safety
                                
                                Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                                
                                Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                                
                                When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                                
                                #Built In Filters
                                
                                The following filters are built in:
                                
                                default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                                withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                                none, which is empty
                                total, which includes just .total
                                
                                #Compatibility with V1.x
                                
                                For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    Gets all the comments that the users in {ids} were mentioned in.
                     
                    Note, to count as a mention the comment must be considered to be "in reply to" a user. Most importantly, this means that a comment can only be in reply to a single user.
                     
                    {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.
                     
                    The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:
                     - creation - creation_date
                     - votes - score
                      It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                     
                    This method returns a list of comments.

                            #Discussion
                            
                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.
                     
                    The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:
                     - creation - creation_date
                     - votes - score
                      creation is the default sort.
                     
                     It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                     
                    This method returns a list of comments.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        This method is useful for extracting conversations, especially over time or across multiple posts.
                         
                        {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects. {toid} can contain only 1 id, found in the same manner as those in {ids}.
                         
                        The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:
                         - creation - creation_date
                         - votes - score
                          creation is the default sort.
                         
                         It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                         
                        This method returns a list of comments.

                                The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                                
                                An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                                
                                Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                                
                                The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                                
                                #Safety
                                
                                Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                                
                                Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                                
                                When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                                
                                #Built In Filters
                                
                                The following filters are built in:
                                
                                default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                                withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                                none, which is empty
                                total, which includes just .total
                                
                                #Compatibility with V1.x
                                
                                For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    This route corresponds roughly to user's stats tab, but does not include tag scores. A subset of tag scores are available (on a single user basis) in /users/{id}/top-answer-tags and /users/{id}/top-question-tags.
                     
                    {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.
                     
                    The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the tag object:
                     - popular - count
                     - activity - the creation_date of the last question asked with the tag
                     - name - name
                      popular is the default sort.
                     
                     It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                     
                    This method returns a list of tags.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
                     - activity - last_activity_date
                     - creation - creation_date
                     - votes - score
                     - added - when the user favorited the question
                      activity is the default sort.
                     
                     It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                     
                    This method returns a list of questions.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    Badge sorts are a tad complicated. For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered to be greater than named.
                     
                    This means that you can get a list of all tag based badges a user has by passing min=tag_based, and conversely all the named badges by passing max=named, with sort=type.
                     
                    For ranks, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver&min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.

                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty

                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty

                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty

These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

                {id} can contain a single id, to find it programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects. {tags} is limited to 5 tags, passing more will result in an error.
                 
                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the answer object:
                 - activity - last_activity_date
                 - creation - creation_date
                 - votes - score
                  activity is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                 
                This method returns a list of answers.

                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                {id} can contain a single id, to find it programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects. {tags} is limited to 5 tags, passing more will result in an error.
                 
                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
                 - activity - last_activity_date
                 - creation - creation_date
                 - votes - score
                  activity is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                 
                This method returns a list of questions.

                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    #Discussion
                    
                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                Returns the tags found on a site that only moderators can use.
                 
                The inname parameter lets a consumer filter down to tags that contain a certain substring. For example, inname=own would return both "download" and "owner" amongst others.
                 
                This method returns a list of tags.
                 
                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the tag object:
                 - popular - count
                 - activity - the creation_date of the last question asked with the tag
                 - name - name
                  popular is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total

                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

        get:

                Returns all tag synonyms found a site.
                 
                When searching for synonyms of specific tags, it is better to use /tags/{tags}/synonyms over this method.
                 
                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the tag_synonym object:
                 - creation - creation_date
                 - applied - applied_count
                 - activity - last_applied_date
                  creation is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                 
                This method returns a list of tag_synonyms.
            queryParameters: 
                filter: 
                    description: |
                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                This method diverges from the standard naming patterns to avoid to conflicting with existing methods, due to the free form nature of tag names.
                 
                This method returns a list of tags.
                 
                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the tag object:
                 - popular - count
                 - activity - the creation_date of the last question asked with the tag
                 - name - name
                  popular is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields

These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty

                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            Returns all sites in the network.
             
            This method allows for discovery of new sites, and changes to existing ones. Be aware that unlike normal API methods, this method should be fetched very infrequently, it is very unusual for these values to change more than once on any given day. It is suggested that you cache its return for at least one day, unless your app encounters evidence that it has changed (such as from the /info method).
             
            The pagesize parameter for this method is unbounded, in acknowledgement that for many applications repeatedly fetching from /sites would complicate start-up tasks needlessly.
             
            This method returns a list of sites.

                    #Discussion
                    
                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            Creates a new filter given a list of includes, excludes, a base filter, and whether or not this filter should be "unsafe".
             
            Filter "safety" is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
             
            If no base filter is specified, the default filter is assumed. When building a filter from scratch, the none built-in filter is useful.
             
            When the size of the parameters being sent to this method grows to large, problems can occur. This method will accept POST requests to mitigate this.
             
            It is not expected that many applications will call this method at runtime, filters should be pre-calculated and "baked in" in the common cases. Furthermore, there are a number of built-in filters which cover common use cases.
             
            This method returns a single filter.

                    #Discussion
                    
                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty

                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty

                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters

                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty

These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                Returns a record of merges that have occurred involving a user identified by an access_token.
                 
                This method allows you to take now invalid account ids and find what account they've become, or take currently valid account ids and find which ids were equivalent in the past.
                 
                This is most useful when confirming that an account_id is in fact "new" to an application.
                 
                Account merges can happen for a wide range of reasons, applications should not make assumptions that merges have particular causes.
                 
                Note that accounts are managed at a network level, users on a site may be merged due to an account level merge but there is no guarantee that a merge has an effect on any particular site.

                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total

                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            #Discussion
                            
                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            #Discussion
                            
                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                This method does not consider the user's current quota (ie. if they've already exhausted it for today) nor any additional restrictions on write access, such as editing deleted comments.

                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total

                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

            Searches a site for any questions which fit the given criteria.
             
            This method is intentionally quite limited. For more general searching, you should use a proper internet search engine restricted to the domain of the site in question.
             
            At least one of tagged or intitle must be set on this method. nottagged is only used if tagged is also set, for performance reasons.
             
            tagged and nottagged are semi-colon delimited list of tags. At least 1 tag in tagged will be on each returned question if it is passed, making it the OR equivalent of the AND version of tagged on /questions.
             
            The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
             - activity - last_activity_date
             - creation - creation_date
             - votes - score
             - relevance - matches the relevance tab on the site itself Does not accept min or max
              activity is the default sort.
             
             It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
             
            This method returns a list of questions.

                    #Discussion
                    
                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                Searches a site for any questions which fit the given criteria.
                 
                Search criteria are expressed using the following parameters:
                  - q - a free form text parameter, will match all question properties based on an undocumented algorithm.
                 - accepted - true to return only questions with accepted answers, false to return only those without. Omit to elide constraint.
                 - answers - the minimum number of answers returned questions must have.
                 - body - text which must appear in returned questions' bodies.
                 - closed - true to return only closed questions, false to return only open ones. Omit to elide constraint.
                 - migrated - true to return only questions migrated away from a site, false to return only those not. Omit to elide constraint.
                 - notice - true to return only questions with post notices, false to return only those without. Omit to elide constraint.
                 - nottagged - a semicolon delimited list of tags, none of which will be present on returned questions.
                 - tagged - a semicolon delimited list of tags, of which at least one will be present on all returned questions.
                 - title - text which must appear in returned questions' titles.
                 - user - the id of the user who must own the questions returned.
                 - url - a url which must be contained in a post, may include a wildcard.
                 - views - the minimum number of views returned questions must have.
                 - wiki - true to return only community wiki questions, false to return only non-community wiki ones. Omit to elide constraint.
                  
                At least one additional parameter must be set if nottagged is set, for performance reasons.
                 
                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
                 - activity - last_activity_date
                 - creation - creation_date
                 - votes - score
                 - relevance - matches the relevance tab on the site itself Does not accept min or max
                  activity is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                 
                This method returns a list of questions.

                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            If you're filtering for interesting comments (by score, creation date, etc.) make use of the sort paramter with appropriate min and max values.
             
            If you're looking to query conversations between users, instead use the /users/{ids}/mentioned and /users/{ids}/comments/{toid} methods.
             
            The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:
             - creation - creation_date
             - votes - score
              creation is the default sort.
             
             It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.

                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty

These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            Returns all the undeleted answers in the system.
             
            The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the answer object:
             - activity - last_activity_date
             - creation - creation_date
             - votes - score
              activity is the default sort.
             
             It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
             
            This method returns a list of answers.

                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the answer object:
                 - activity - last_activity_date
                 - creation - creation_date
                 - votes - score
                  activity is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                 
                This method returns a list of answers.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            Fetches all posts (questions and answers) on the site.
             
            In many ways this method is the union of /questions and /answers, returning both sets of data albeit only the common fields.
             
            Most applications should use the question or answer specific methods, but /posts is available for those rare cases where any activity is of intereset. Examples of such queries would be: "all posts on Jan. 1st 2011" or "top 10 posts by score of all time".
             
            The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the post object:
             - activity - last_activity_date
             - creation - creation_date
             - votes - score
              activity is the default sort.
             
             It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
             
            This method returns a list of posts.

                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.

                Fetches a set of posts by ids.
                 
                This method is meant for grabbing an object when unsure whether an id identifies a question or an answer. This is most common with user entered data.
                 
                {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for post_id, answer_id, or question_id on post, answer, and question objects respectively.
                 
                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the post object:
                 - activity - last_activity_date
                 - creation - creation_date
                 - votes - score
                  activity is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                 
                This method returns a list of posts.

                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            #Discussion
                            
                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    Gets the comments on the posts identified in ids, regardless of the type of the posts.
                     
                    This method is meant for cases when you are unsure of the type of the post id provided. Generally, this would be due to obtaining the post id directly from a user.
                     
                    {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for post_id, answer_id, or question_id on post, answer, and question objects respectively.
                     
                    The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:
                     - creation - creation_date
                     - votes - score
                      creation is the default sort.
                     
                     It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                     
                    This method returns a list of comments.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth.

                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            Returns all the badges in the system.
             
            Badge sorts are a tad complicated. For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered to be greater than named.
             
            This means that you can get a list of all tag based badges by passing min=tag_based, and conversely all the named badges by passing max=named, with sort=type.
             
            For ranks, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver&min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.
             
            rank is the default sort.
             
            This method returns a list of badges.

                    #Discussion
                    
                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                Gets the badges identified in id.
                 
                Note that badge ids are not constant across sites, and thus should be looked up via the /badges method. A badge id on a single site is, however, guaranteed to be stable.
                 
                Badge sorts are a tad complicated. For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered to be greater than named.
                 
                This means that you can get a list of all tag based badges by passing min=tag_based, and conversely all the named badges by passing max=named, with sort=type.
                 
                For ranks, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort=rank, set max=gold for just gold badges, max=silver&min=silver for just silver, and min=bronze for just bronze.
                 
                rank is the default sort.
                 
                {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for badge_id on badge objects.
                 
                This method returns a list of badges.

                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            #Discussion
                            
                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            Returns questions which are similar to a hypothetical one based on a title and tag combination.
             
            This method is roughly equivalent to a site's related questions suggestion on the ask page.
             
            This method is useful for correlating data outside of a Stack Exchange site with similar content within one.
             
            Note that title must always be passed as a parameter. tagged and nottagged are optional, semi-colon delimited lists of tags.
             
            If tagged is passed it is treated as a preference, there is no guarantee that questions returned will have any of those tags. nottagged is treated as a requirement, no questions will be returned with those tags.
             
            The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
             - activity - last_activity_date
             - creation - creation_date
             - votes - score
             - relevance - order by "how similar" the questions are, most likely candidate first with a descending order Does not accept min or max
              activity is the default sort.
             
             It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

                    #Discussion
                    
                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

            Gets all the questions on the site.
             
            This method allows you make fairly flexible queries across the entire corpus of questions on a site. For example, getting all questions asked in the the week of Jan 1st 2011 with scores of 10 or more is a single query with parameters sort=votes&min=10&fromdate=1293840000&todate=1294444800.
             
            To constrain questions returned to those with a set of tags, use the tagged parameter with a semi-colon delimited list of tags. This is an and contraint, passing tagged=c;java will return only those questions with both tags. As such, passing more than 5 tags will always return zero results.
             
            The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
             - activity - last_activity_date
             - creation - creation_date
             - votes - score
             - hot - by the formula ordering the hot tab Does not accept min or max
             - week - by the formula ordering the week tab Does not accept min or max
             - month - by the formula ordering the month tab Does not accept min or max
              activity is the default sort.
             
             It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
             
            This method returns a list of questions.

                    The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                    
                    An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                    
                    Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                    
                    The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                    
                    #Safety
                    
                    Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                    
                    Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                    
                    When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                    
                    #Built In Filters
                    
                    The following filters are built in:
                    
                    default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                    withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                    none, which is empty
                    total, which includes just .total
                    
                    #Compatibility with V1.x
                    
                    For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                Returns the questions identified in {ids}.
                 
                This is most useful for fetching fresh data when maintaining a cache of question ids, or polling for changes.
                 
                {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for question_id on question objects.
                 
                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
                 - activity - last_activity_date
                 - creation - creation_date
                 - votes - score
                  activity is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                 
                This method returns a list of questions.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    Returns questions that the site considers related to those identified in {ids}.
                     
                    The algorithm for determining if questions are related is not documented, and subject to change at any time. Futhermore, these values are very heavily cached, and may not update immediately after a question has been editted. It is also not guaranteed that a question will be considered related to any number (even non-zero) of questions, and a consumer should be able to handle a variable number of returned questions.
                     
                    {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for question_id on question objects.
                     
                    The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
                     - activity - last_activity_date
                     - creation - creation_date
                     - votes - score
                     - rank - a priority sort by site applies, subject to change at any time Does not accept min or max
                      activity is the default sort.
                     
                     It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                     
                    This method returns a list of questions.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    Gets the comments on a question.
                     
                    If you know that you have an question id and need the comments, use this method. If you know you have a answer id, use /answers/{ids}/comments. If you are unsure, use /posts/{ids}/comments.
                     
                    {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for question_id on question objects.
                     
                    The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:
                     - creation - creation_date
                     - votes - score
                      creation is the default sort.
                     
                     It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                     
                    This method returns a list of comments.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    Gets the answers to a set of questions identified in id.
                     
                    This method is most useful if you have a set of interesting questions, and you wish to obtain all of their answers at once or if you are polling for new or updates answers (in conjunction with sort=activity).
                     
                    {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for question_id on question objects.
                     
                    The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the answer object:
                     - activity - last_activity_date
                     - creation - creation_date
                     - votes - score
                      activity is the default sort.
                     
                     It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                     
                    This method returns a list of answers.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                    Gets questions which link to those questions identified in {ids}.
                     
                    This method only considers questions that are linked within a site, and will never return questions from another Stack Exchange site.
                     
                    A question is considered "linked" when it explicitly includes a hyperlink to another question, there are no other heuristics.
                     
                    {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for question_id on question objects.
                     
                    The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
                     - activity - last_activity_date
                     - creation - creation_date
                     - votes - score
                     - rank - a priority sort by site applies, subject to change at any time Does not accept min or max
                      activity is the default sort.
                     
                     It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                     
                    This method returns a list of questions.

                            #Discussion
                            
                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                            The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                            
                            An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                            
                            Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                            
                            The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                            
                            #Safety
                            
                            Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                            
                            Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                            
                            When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                            
                            #Built In Filters
                            
                            The following filters are built in:
                            
                            default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                            withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                            none, which is empty
                            total, which includes just .total
                            
                            #Compatibility with V1.x
                            
                            For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                Returns all the questions with active bounties in the system.
                 
                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
                 - activity - last_activity_date
                 - creation - creation_date
                 - votes - score
                  activity is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                 
                This method returns a list of questions.

                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                Returns questions the site considers to be unanswered.
                 
                Note that just because a question has an answer, that does not mean it is considered answered. While the rules are subject to change, at this time a question must have at least one upvoted answer to be considered answered.
                 
                To constrain questions returned to those with a set of tags, use the tagged parameter with a semi-colon delimited list of tags. This is an and contraint, passing tagged=c;java will return only those questions with both tags. As such, passing more than 5 tags will always return zero results.
                 
                Compare with /questions/no-answers.
                 
                This method corresponds roughly with the unanswered tab.
                 
                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
                 - activity - last_activity_date
                 - creation - creation_date
                 - votes - score
                  activity is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                 
                This method returns a list of questions.

                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

                Returns questions which have received no answers.
                 
                Compare with /questions/unanswered which mearly returns questions that the sites consider insufficiently well answered.
                 
                This method corresponds roughly with the this site tab.
                 
                To constrain questions returned to those with a set of tags, use the tagged parameter with a semi-colon delimited list of tags. This is an and contraint, passing tagged=c;java will return only those questions with both tags. As such, passing more than 5 tags will always return zero results.
                 
                The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
                 - activity - last_activity_date
                 - creation - creation_date
                 - votes - score
                  activity is the default sort.
                 
                 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
                 
                This method returns a list of questions.
            queryParameters: 
                filter: 
                    description: |
                        #Discussion
                        
                        The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.
                        
                        An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.
                        
                        Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.
                        
                        The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).
                        
                        #Safety
                        
                        Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.
                        
                        Note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).
                        
                        When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.
                        
                        #Built In Filters
                        
                        The following filters are built in:
                        
                        default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers).
                        withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields
                        none, which is empty
                        total, which includes just .total
                        
                        #Compatibility with V1.x
                        
                        For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.
