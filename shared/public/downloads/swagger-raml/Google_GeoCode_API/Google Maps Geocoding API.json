    "description" : "The Google Maps Geocoding API is a service that provides geocoding and reverse geocoding of addresses. Convert addresses into geographic coordinates (geocoding), which you can use to place markers or position the map. This API also allows you to convert geographic coordinates into an address (reverse geocoding).\n\nGeocoding is the process of converting addresses (like a street address) into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.\nReverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address. The Google Maps Geocoding API's reverse geocoding service also lets you find the address for a given place ID.\n\nDetailed documentation for the Google Maps Geocoding API is available at:\nhttps://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start",

To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.\nIf a name is not available in the preferred language, the geocoder uses the closest match.\nThe preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another.
